- ORCA Steps
		- input (in sequence): analyzedText # orcaCollection-level URN # analysisObjectURN # deformedText # exemplarID
		- Params: `orcaAnalysis(orcaFile, orcaCollectionUrn, exemplarId, collectionVersion)`
		- Make Collection
		- Make CTS tab
			- start with seq = 0; prev = null
			- Make PrevArrayList since we can't write it out until we know Next values for each line
			- GVR for analyzedTextURN = how many records. These will be tab-lines in PrevArrayList
			- for eachWithIndex
				- if editionLeaf == null
					- start with leafNum = 1
					- PrevSeq == null
				- else
					- leafNum++
			- Capture PrevSeq
			- seq++
			- construct URN, exemplarID and leafNum
			- if index = 0, add seq as "next" to PrevArrayList and write out.
			- Get text-content
			- If the last one:
				- save EditionLeaf
			- Save seq as PrevSeq
